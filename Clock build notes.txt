=========== Wall Clock 01/02: ===========

without pendulum (just anchor):
Runs for a few hours with the 1.5kg cuckoo weight
Runs only for a few minutes with a 420g cuckoo weight

This might be improved once the pendulum is fitted - the anchor is clearly driven by the escape wheel and not by its own period
-after using wire to hold the plates in place, it has run for ~24hours with 420g

Need the weights to be further from the wall!
Need more space between chains and anchor/pendulum
-chain at front, and pendulum further away

Really do need the chain wheel at the bottom for stability
-done

Had to file away part of the bearing holder for the minute wheel to get the next wheel to fit
-done, not extending bearing holders

The gears are easily strong enoguh and could be reduced in thickness, maybe module too
-done, untested

The plates aren't really strong enough - but might be if they were closer together or printed in higher toughness
-done

The gears lose a lot of grip on the threaded rod if they have to be removed and re-threaded - will want to think about a better way of garenteeing motion from the minute wheel to the shaft - maybe a nyloc nut?
-done, but untested
nyloc nut worked, but introduces wobblyness of the wheel if it's too thin

The pendulum knife edge might need to be longer - it wobbles all over the place
-going to test having pendulum on same rod as anchor and not using knife edge for now

Pendulum bob and nut work, but the bob rotates slowly. Needs something to prevent it from doing that - usually the pendulum rod isn't round the whole way down
-planning to try nyloc nut in the bob nut (worked)

Plans for next clock:
Make bob small and round, so it doesn't matter if it rotates a bit - might need something to prevent it from loosening/tightening itself? Or will it not have this problem if it's a different shape?
Use nyloc nut to attach main wheel to the rod, then try a spring rather than just tight nuts to hold the motion works to the same rod.
Make motion works shorter - they don't need to be quite as long as they are, I'm not actually planning on hiding them behind a dial

the chainwheel could have either a section of pipe that slots over the rod, or space for one or two bearings - this should reduce the chance it turns the hands backwards when being wound up


Maybe consider making a fancy handnut piece that goes over a normal nut to make the hands slightly tidier?


============== Wall Clock 03 =============

works! Had problems with it stopping, turned out to be some globs of PETG in one of the teeth. the smaller teeth I suspect make it more suseptical to it

Will be worth far more thoroughly inspecting teeth in the future
DONE worked with clock 4

Permanently attached pendulum is a bad idea, although the anchor and pendulum on the same rod works quite well. Try some sort of hook on the rod attachment so the main pendulum can be removed?
DONE but didn't work well

The clock plates are far thicker and wider than they need to be. The width also hides the smaller gears. Future plan: make the plates as narrow as possible
DONE clock 4 looks great

the tick is less satisfying than the previous clock. Maybe go back to a larger escape wheel? Could a fully solid escape wheel without the HAC styling still go "clunk"?
DONEish clock 4 the tick is less anoying but a lot quieter in general

thoughts: having the escape wheel to the left/right of the anchor would make the clock less tall and might help with increasing the size of the gears again
Planning a "compact" clock plate design

It's very easy to knock the clock out of beat when winding up the weight or adjusting the pendulum. Some grippy pads on the back might help?
DONE stick on grippy pads from RS work really well

=================== Wall clock 04 =====================

Might be worth ensuring the bottom-side (as printed) of as many parts as possible is forwards. The bottom of the anchor is considerably more neat and tidy than the top
Could have made the design more compact (height-wise), as the large first wheel has enough space for the small second wheel to interlock
PART-DONE only anchor

The minute wheel is very wonky - looks like it's always pulled forwards by the chain. Maybe consider keeping this one thicker and reducing the size of the hole in the chain wheel, so it's got less angle to pull?
I think this has always been the case, but the large and thin minute wheel has amplified it here.
TRYING reducing diameter of hole in chain wheel, keeping chain wheel thicker and using superglue/threadlock instead of a nyloc nut

Might be worth considering printing spacers, or going back to the bearing-holderst that stick out from the clock plates. It takes a long time to get all the gears lined up when I'm manually adjusting lots of little nyloc nuts.
PLAN - output a list of measurements for where to align the nyloc nuts, and just put nyloc nuts on all arbours. Maybe consider elongating the pinion if there's not enough space for a nut?

The new deadbeat escapement seems pretty good. The pendulum does have a wide swing (need to measure, see if it really is 5deg), so for longer pendulums I'll want to reduce this a bit maybe?
THOUGHT - looking closely I'm wondering if it's over-swinging quite a lot. If I actually weight the bob down, then this should reduce? (power from escapement will then be less compared to its total mass?)
Yes - increasing mass of pendulum or reducing mass of the weight reduces overswinging. Don't know what impact that has on timekeeping yet.
not noticed much difference in timekeeping with different weights yet

There is a noticable little clunk when the chain segment leaves the chain wheel. Will be worth reducing the tolerance on that a tiny bit.

The anchor threaded slightly wonky, and is also very loose, even with the nyloc nut. Might be worth making this thicker too! Or giving it a little sticky out bit. If I overhaul this to use a bushing and knife-edge then this might fall out of that work
FIXED (made longer)

The detachable pendulum needed a nut to keep it from being too wobbly - so it didn't really work. again real bushing + knife edge would fix this
FIXED (not using real bushing yet)

The lid of the weight isn't very easy to fit
FIXED

Inspecting the teeth and using a small file on any irregularities appears to have paid off - only times gears have got stuck is because they weren't lined up and the wonky minute wheel problem.

Is it worth always having a chain wheel in future? This means the one day clocks can be mounted lower on the wall and it sidesteps the wonky minute wheel


General thought - is it worth designing a clock to be hung from the picture rail? Legs sticking out the top and bottom at the back, with a hook fairly far forwards on the top might do the job

Go back to the larger screw hole + maybe give the back plate an extra circular bulge to accomodate it?

Escape wheel - worth making the teeth not pointed? they print with a small blunt end anyway, and this way I don't need the printed length bodge

Clock 5:
Somehow the anchor was still printed upside down, so it's still not the nice side visible!

I completely forgot about how big the weight is - it needs the pendulum away from the clock face. I'm going to try just putting it further along the rod, but it really needed some pendulumSticksOut!
I've decided to shrink the hands rather than have them stick out by miles

The arbour extensions are a fiddle to put on, but they make it much easier to assemble the clock! Worth keeping, plus I like the look.

Still not sure I got the chain wheel quite perfect for the heavier duty chain. Also, might want to beef up the lugs that hold the chain - I think they can be widened without affecting the function

IDEA - since winding up the eight day can knock it out of beat easily - how about a screw-slot at the bottom that can be used to fix it in place once it's been put in beat?

IDEA - also a tool (with long handle) to hold the anchor to make it easier to put in beat

REFACTOR - I think that the circular and vertical clock plates can be combined, they're actually very similar. Then there's only one thing to maintain

thought for the grasshopper, or others to show off the mechanism: the front plate could cover only the chain wheel (maybe the motion works and minute wheel too?), the rest of the gears have the bearing embedded in the gear itself, and are simply bolted onto the rear plate. How do I hold the pendulum?? Could I offset from the wall on little legs and have the pendulum out the back?

Can I reduce the thickness of the ratchet (the bit attached to the gear) on the chain wheel?
