=========== Wall Clock 01/02: ===========

without pendulum (just anchor):
Runs for a few hours with the 1.5kg cuckoo weight
Runs only for a few minutes with a 420g cuckoo weight

This might be improved once the pendulum is fitted - the anchor is clearly driven by the escape wheel and not by its own period
-after using wire to hold the plates in place, it has run for ~24hours with 420g

Need the weights to be further from the wall!
Need more space between chains and anchor/pendulum
-chain at front, and pendulum further away

Really do need the chain wheel at the bottom for stability
-done

Had to file away part of the bearing holder for the minute wheel to get the next wheel to fit
-done, not extending bearing holders

The gears are easily strong enoguh and could be reduced in thickness, maybe module too
-done, untested

The plates aren't really strong enough - but might be if they were closer together or printed in higher toughness
-done

The gears lose a lot of grip on the threaded rod if they have to be removed and re-threaded - will want to think about a better way of garenteeing motion from the minute wheel to the shaft - maybe a nyloc nut?
-done, but untested

The pendulum knife edge might need to be longer - it wobbles all over the place
-going to test having pendulum on same rod as anchor and not using knife edge for now

Pendulum bob and nut work, but the bob rotates slowly. Needs something to prevent it from doing that - usually the pendulum rod isn't round the whole way down
-planning to try nyloc nut in the bob nut

Plans for next clock:
Make bob small and round, so it doesn't matter if it rotates a bit - might need something to prevent it from loosening/tightening itself? Or will it not have this problem if it's a different shape?
Use nyloc nut to attach main wheel to the rod, then try a spring rather than just tight nuts to hold the motion works to the same rod.
Make motion works shorter - they don't need to be quite as long as they are, I'm not actually planning on hiding them behind a dial

the chainwheel could have either a section of pipe that slots over the rod, or space for one or two bearings - this should reduce the chance it turns the hands backwards when being wound up


Maybe consider making a fancy handnut piece that goes over a normal nut to make the hands slightly tidier?


============== Wall Clock 03 =============

works! Had problems with it stopping, turned out to be some globs of PETG in one of the teeth. the smaller teeth I suspect make it more suseptical to it

Will be worth far more thoroughly inspecting teeth in the future

Permanently attached pendulum is a bad idea, although the anchor and pendulum on the same rod works quite well. Try some sort of hook on the rod attachment so the main pendulum can be removed?

The clock plates are far thicker and wider than they need to be. The width also hides the smaller gears. Future plan: make the plates as narrow as possible

the tick is less satisfying than the previous clock. Maybe go back to a larger escape wheel? Could a fully solid escape wheel without the HAC styling still go "clunk"?

thoughts: having the escape wheel to the left/right of the anchor would make the clock less tall and might help with increasing the size of the gears again

It's very easy to knock the clock out of beat when winding up the weight or adjusting the pendulum. Some grippy pads on the back might help?


=================== Wall clock 04 =====================

Might be worth ensuring the bottom-side (as printed) of as many parts as possible is forwards. The bottom of the anchor is considerably more neat and tidy than the top
Could have made the design more compact (height-wise), as the large first wheel has enough space for the small second wheel to interlock
