# 3DPrintedClocks
Various bits and bobs for 3D clocks and accessories

##Cuckoo bits
This can generate a pendulum rod + pendulum bob fixing for a cuckoo clock. Designed to be the same as traditional cuckoo clocks, and therefore as hard to set accurately.

##Leaves
Can generate a reasonable cuckoo clock leaf, designed for gluing to the pendulum bob fixing.
