# 3DPrintedClocks
Various bits and bobs for 3D printing clocks and accessories. Licenced under GNU GPL-3.0-or-later. 

## Cuckoo bits
This can generate a pendulum rod + pendulum bob fixing for a cuckoo clock. Designed to be the same as traditional cuckoo clocks, and therefore as hard to set accurately.

## Leaves
Can generate a reasonable cuckoo clock leaf, designed for gluing to the pendulum bob fixing.
