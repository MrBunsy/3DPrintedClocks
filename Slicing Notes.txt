Chain Wheels

adjust layer height on the angled bit of the wheel to make as smooth as possible


on wheels with smaller pinions, need a modifier on the pinion to allow Fill Gaps and Gap Fill Speed just for the pinion


Brass PETG:
220C on mk3 0.4 nozzle works really well

Most PETG mk4 in cupboard:
0.6nozzle 230C works well

dark green PETG in cupboard:
225C 0.6 nozzle


Red (even the new red) with 0.25 nozzle needs at least as low as 225C. 225C still has problems on the thin extension, try 220C next time.

ASA experiments:
using prusament ASA as a starting config
polylite dark blue ASA seemed to print well at 250C with 0.4 nozzle, slightly lower might be even better for small parts
need to keep parts away from edge of build plate to avoid warping

trying 240 for 3djake ASA as it says a max of 250
was warping badly, TO DO try same as polylite and maybe with reduced volumetric flow
