# Printing Parts
An FDM printer is assumed. I have not tried resin printing, I suspect it would not be strong enough. I use a Prusa Mk3s and Mk4. PETG doesn't print especially well on a mini (bowden extruder) but I expect any well calibrated machine with a direct drive extruder to be suitable..

Most parts are best printed in PETG as it's strong and doesn't warp easily. Some decorative parts (hands, dial) could probably be printed in PLA without any issue, but I have used PETG so I can print them on a textured sheet.

A few parts are best printed in ASA for strength - so far this is only for mainspring driven clocks.

# Wheels (gears)
The wheels and pinions are by far the hardest part to print. If you want to print a clock I recommend starting with an arbor to check your printer is up to the task.
