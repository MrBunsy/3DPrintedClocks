# Clock List
Details of all the generatable clocks. Most clocks have a git tag with their name - some of the older clocks I forgot to do this.

### Wall Clock 01
Abandoned - partially printed until I realised the gear train was too large to fit on a plate

### Wall Clock 02
First clock, but the original plates were too filmsy to hold itself together without messing up the depthing. Demonstrated that the idea had merit!

### Wall Clock 03
First working clock, but had problems with the winding mechanism and hands causing the rod to be threaded through the powered wheel. Fixed with superglue, lasted two and a half years before the old style ratchet failed.

Hubert Hurr chain driven 30 hour.

### Wall Clock 04
Been running reliably since it was built. Uses a lighter weight than clock 03, so I expect the ratchet it last a little longer.

Regula chain driven 30 hour.

### Wall Clock 05
First attempt at an eight day clock. Used a stronger Regula chain, but this failed catastrophically after a few days with a 2.5kg weight. The original chain stretched and the chain wheel broke.
Since retrofitted with the newer pocket chain wheels, given degreased and oiled bearings and it's running reliably with 1.25kg

### Wall Clock 06
First reliable eight day clock. Uses a cord and key instead of a chain. This was printed after clock 07, which was used to test the cord wheel.
Flaw: the anchor is able to press up against the front plate. Needs pushing back to keep reliable

### Wall Clock 07
30 hour weight driven using a cord, with one cord to pull to wind it up. Works, has been reliable since it was built and on printables.
Flaw: has the anchor able to press up against the front plate, but sufficiently over-powered that this isn't a major issue.

### Wall Clock 08
Unfinished and unprinted experiment to reduce the size of clock 06.

### Wall Clock 09
Another unfinished and unprinted experiment to reduce the size of clock 06.

### Wall Clock 10
First clock to use a pulley. Works, but required retrofitting a stronger cord wheel.

Weight driven (on a cord). Still running.

### Wall Clock 11
First attempt at a rope clock, using friction to hold the rope. I wanted a drop in replacement for a chain that didn't have the problems that killed clock 05. 

First attempt didn't work, but retrofitted a few attempts and settled on using some rubber O-rings and it works okay. Needs fairly large counterweight, so was never viable for eight day.

Printed on a mini.

### Wall Clock 12
This was printed somewhat later - after the grasshoppers. Originally was going to be an improved clock 10
First attempt at a centred seconds hand on an eight day clock.

Works, but there's lots of slack in the minute hand. Completely dry bearings eventually failed.

### Wall Clock 13
This was intended to be a reliable clock as a gift, so the focus was on reliability. It's basically clock 07 but with a chain.

30 hour chain with small seconds hand and short pendulum.

### Wall Clock 14
First attempt at a grasshopper. Works! There's a fair bit of droop on the escape wheel, which means the geometry isn't perfect.

This has since been retrofitted with a "direct anchor arbor" where the anchor is directly fixed to the pendulum holder with no way to adjust the beat.

30 hour chain with huygens maintaining power. Still ticking, after upgrading the bearings to degreased and oiled.

### Wall Clock 15
Second grasshopper, with different way of holding the escape wheel to try and ensure the geometry was more accurate. Largely successful.

Still ticking in its original form, after upgrading the bearings to degreased and oiled.

### Wall Clock 16
Experiment to use the new option to have the escapement on the front. Never printed.

This idea finally saw the light of day with the brocot escapment and the much delayed print of clock 25.

### Wall Clock 17
Christmas themed grasshopper. Nothing different to clock 15.

This clock was when I first tried a "direct anchor arbor" and discovered larger bearings have too much friction and started experimenting with degreased bearings.

Discovering how much less friction degreased and oiled bearings have paved the way to centred seconds hands and finishing clock 12.

### Wall Clock 18
Experiment to design an eight day grasshopper. Never finished as I haven't got a reliable enough sprocket to support the weight needed.

### Wall Clock 19
First actually printed clock to have a centred seconds hand. Only 30 hour to test the idea before clock 12 was printed.

First attempt was with rope power, but my attempts at slicing braided cord failed and I switched it to chain.

### Wall Clock 20
Another clock designed as a gift, this time an eight day.

First clock to use a dial.  Period is not a nice fraction of a second, despite having a sub-seconds dial.

Discovered a flaw in my pinion design when generating pinions with large (20+) numbers of leaves. Retrofitted a bodge which has proven reliable.

Eight day cord driven weight with short pendulum.

### Wall Clock 21
Another unfinished attempt at an eight day grasshopper. Abandoned.

### Wall Clock 22
Tony the Clock from Don't Hug Me I'm Scared. Experiment with really small gears and moving eyes. First attempt at a more compact gear layout, staggering the wheels.

The small gears have mostly worked, the eye mechanism added a lot of friction when driven by the pendulum. I've driven it instead from a wheel, but this was causing it to jam. The eyes currently don't move while I think about better ways to drive them.

First working eight day chain driven clock with the new pocket wheel. Not perfect as you still get small "clunks" as a chain segment is released.

### Wall Clock 23
First clock with a moon phase complication. Used the new compact gear layout combined with the older known good gear train.

Eight day, cord driven, 1.5s period.

### Wall Clock 24
Intended as a gift, this went through many iterations before actually being printed some time later.

Ended up as an eight day cord driven brocot escapement.

### Wall Clock 25
Was originally an experiment to design a gear train which could run for a month.

It was actually printed after clocks 32/33, when I'd perfected the new round plates and stronger gears for spring clocks.

32 day cord driven with seconds pendulum.

### Wall Clock 26
Not printed - developed when it looked like clock 20 was unreliable. Turned out to be a problem with pinions with lots of leaves, so this was never needed.

### Mantel Clock 27
First attempt at a mainspring driven clock. I decided to go all in and test an eight day design using an old Smiths mainspring.

Worked first time! After a few months it wasn't reliably running for a week, but switching out all the bearings for degreased and oiled and oiling the mainspring has fixed this.

Has a sub-seconds dial and eight day spring.

### Wall Clock 28
Attempted to fix the slack in the minute hand on centred seconds hands.

This was destined to be a gift, but hasn't proven reliable. I think it's because it was my one of first attempts at running stainless bearings dry. Going to refit with oiled bearings.

### Mantel Clock 29
Attempt at reducing size of clock 27. First attempt failed spectacularly. I fixed it by reprinting exactly the same parts with a 0.6mm nozzle and using an older more set mainspring.

Centred second hand, eight day spring.

### Mantel Clock 30
I developed lantern pinions for this clock, which is an attempt at reducing overall size of a spring clock but increasing strength.

Largely a success - uses a brand new mainspring. Not my most reliable clock, I suspect my current mechanism for centred second hands is just not very good.

### Mantel Clock 31
First attempt at making a more traditionally styled clock, and using a smaller mainspring, and using 2mm arbors and smaller modules A mainspring driven brocot escapement.

Doesn't work - very unreliable. I should have tried fewer new ideas at once. Also was pretty ugly in my opinion, although the dial has attracted positive comments.

### Wall Clock 32
Spring driven wall clock with a tweaked version of the moon escapement that puts a small moon where a sub-seconds dial would otherwise be.

This clock lead to discovering that dry stainless steel bearings seize up over time. I suspect my degreasing technique is sub-par, but just a drop of oil is enough to fix the problem.

This uses the new fully round clock plates and raised-edging style, printed with dark green and brass. I'm really pleased with how this one came out.

Eight day spring driven with short 0.5s beat pendulum.

### Mantle Clock 33
Basically a mantel version of clock 32, with a 1/3 beat pendulum.

First clock to use a plaque rather than multi-material text on the back plate, as that often printed badly.

Eight day spring driven.

### Mantle clock 34
Still not printed, was planned to be clock 33 but without the moon.

### Wall Clock 35
Not printed, an experiment in a spring powered brocot wall clock.

### Wall Clock 36
Not printed, an experiment on making a clock for a child interested in clocks. Plan was to make it really robust and safe, with the mechanism as visible as possible.

### Wall Clock 37
Not printed, experiment to have clock 32 but cord driven.
